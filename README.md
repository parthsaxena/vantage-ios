# Vantage
**_Note:_** This is the new version of Vantage built in Firebase rather than our original 
custom-built backend.

Vantage is a mobile application and web portal designed to assist students with their academic needs.
Students can snap a picture of their homework, assignment, or problem, and have it completed shortly.
Users can complete other users' assignments to earn coins which can eventually be used to redeem gift cards.
